# OBD‑Droid

**Full-stack Android diagnostics suite built for technicians, tuners, and enthusiasts.**

OBD‑Droid turns any ELM327-compatible adapter into a professional-grade vehicle workstation. From live telemetry to AutoCheck intelligence and an AI copilot, every module is engineered to make complex diagnostics feel effortless.

> **TL;DR**
> - Plug in any ELM327 adapter, launch the Android app, and get live data in under a minute.
> - One tap runs a full ECU scan, logs CSV/GPS telemetry, and syncs findings with your AI copilot.
> - Safety recalls, AutoCheck history, VIN decode, and report exports are all presented in-app with the same cohesive UI.

## 🚀 Why It Stands Out

- **Mission Control for Your Vehicle** – Real-time dashboards, custom PIDs, HUD mode, and CSV/GPS logging.
- **Deep Diagnostics Pipeline** – ECU discovery, freeze frames, emissions readiness, and health scoring in one flow.
- **VIN-Aware Intelligence** – AutoCheck history with ownership, odometer, and open recalls side-by-side with NHTSA data.
- **AI Copilot** – OpenAI ChatGPT delivers contextual answers using live vehicle data and prior conversations.
- **Modular Architecture** – Service-driven Android app, standalone companion APIs, and reusable libraries.

> _“From handshake to fix recommendation, OBD‑Droid shows how far Android can stretch inside the garage.”_

```

- **Separation of Concerns** – OBD stack lives in its own package, while UI features orchestrate data via managers/services.
- **Request Queues & Caching** – Vehicle data service caches VIN lookups; in-app caching enables instant revisit offline.
- **Configurable Telemetry** – Logging and AI features respond to user settings stored in `SharedPreferences`.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio **Giraffe** (or newer) with **JDK 17**.
- Android SDK targets **API 21 – 34** (Android 5.0 – 14).
- Physical Android device (recommended) with Bluetooth or USB host support.
- ELM327-compatible OBD-II adapter (Bluetooth Classic, BLE serial, USB, or Wi-Fi).

### Clone & Bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wal33D/OBD-Droid.git
cd OBD-Droid

# Pull bundled libraries (DTC database, logos, NHTSA bindings)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build & install debug variant
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug

# Launch on device
adb shell am start -n com.obddroid/.ui.activities.MainActivity
```

> **Note:** The Vehicle History feature requires a **private AutoCheck backend** that you host yourself. This is not included in the open-source release. If you have access to AutoCheck data through your own dealership or subscription, you can stand up your own backend and configure the endpoint in `local.properties`. All other features (live data, fault codes, emissions, recalls via NHTSA, AI copilot) work without it.

### Android Auto (Desktop Head Unit)

Android Auto shows adapter status, live data, and the last-read fault codes from the connection made in the phone app (`com.obddroid.car`). Connect to the adapter on the phone first; the car screens don't open their own connection.

1. In Android Studio's SDK Manager → **SDK Tools**, install **Android Auto Desktop Head Unit Emulator**.
2. Use a phone emulator with a **Google Play** system image (or a real phone) that has the Android Auto app.
3. In Android Auto settings, tap **Version** 10 times to enable developer mode. Then, from the overflow menu, enable **Unknown sources** and choose **Start head unit server**.
4. Install the debug build and start the DHU:

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
adb forward tcp:5277 tcp:5277
$ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/auto/desktop-head-unit
```

Without a physical adapter, run an ELM327 simulator on your computer (`pip install ELM327-emulator`, then `elm -n 35000`). In the app's adapter screen, choose **Wi-Fi** with IP `10.0.2.2` and port `35000`.

---

## 🧪 Developer Workflow

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Clean build | `./gradlew clean` |
| Compile sources | `./gradlew :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac` |
| Unit tests | `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` |
| Lint & static analysis | `./gradlew :app:lintDebug` |
| Instrumentation tests | `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` |
| Generate signed bundle | `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease` |

**Environment toggles**
- `gradle.properties` houses feature flags, logging verbosity, and Claude API settings.
- `app/build.gradle` encapsulates flavors, signing configs, and dependency graph.

---

## 🔌 Integrations

| Integration | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vehicle Data Service** | Premium vehicle history & open recall data | **Private — not included.** Requires your own AutoCheck backend. Configure endpoint and API key in `local.properties`. |
| **NHTSA Recall API** | Campaign listings, remedy info, VIN decodes | Back bone for “All Recalls” tab and VIN decoder. |
| **OpenAI ChatGPT** | Conversational diagnostics | Context-aware responses with client-side redaction. |
| **VIN Decoder** | Make/model/trim heuristics | Normalizes manufacturer naming for recall lookups. |

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Jetpack Compose migration for telemetry dashboards.
- [ ] BLE adapter improvements and auto-reconnect heuristics.
- [ ] Cloud sync for baseline scans and AutoCheck reports.
- [ ] In-app marketplace for pro data packs (TSBs, repair procedures).
- [x] Integrate AutoCheck open recalls alongside NHTSA campaigns.
- [x] Material-compliant segmented toggle for recalls UI.
